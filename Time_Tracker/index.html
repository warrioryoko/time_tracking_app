  // Okay. So, I'm using the Fetch API, since it's just so much easier than using the old XMLHttpRequest back from the days we all used raw JQuery and AJAX requests.
  // It's incorporated into Firefox 39 and later, and Chrome 42 and later, but to ensure a (more) consistent user experience, I need to package it in the app
  // just in case. I'd prefer to just include it in the application files, rather than download it at runtime, in much the same way as handling JQuery.
  // Fetch returns promises. I'm just fine with using Promises, and for the most part, otherwise confining callbacks to the way I design my handlers to confine
  // state to one component
